Over the course of examining search, we'll make more and more complex assumptions about the search.

Started with uninformed search (made practically no assumptions, just manipulated states and operations).

Let's define intelligence.

What is biological intelligence?
-----
Sensory processing:
    - Visual cortex
    - Auditory cortex
    - Somatosensory cortex
Motor cortex
Cognitive functions:
    Memory formation, recall
    etc.

Mainly, a mix of general and special purpose algorithms:
    General purpose:
        Memory formation, updating, retrieval.
        Learning new tasks
    Special purpose:
        Recognizing visual patterns,
        Recognizing sounds,
        Learning language.
Integrated seamlessly!

Modern notion of a machine is not necessary to implement an AI.

How to implement "acting rationally"?
-----
Doing what is expected to maximize goal achievement, given the available information and available resources.
    Does not necessarily require thinking (e.g. blinking, recoiling from a hot stove)
    But in many cases, thinking serves rational behaviour.

**"Acting rationally" is the flavour of AI that we'll focus on.**

Rational agents
-----
The course is about designing rational agents.
An agent is an entity that perceives and acts.
